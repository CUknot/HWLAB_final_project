Finished Parsing XDC File [C:/Users/User/Desktop/project_1/project_1.srcs/constrs_1/imports/new/uart_system.xdc]
INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [C:/Users/User/Desktop/project_1/project_1.srcs/constrs_1/imports/new/uart_system.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

INFO: [Synth 8-7052] The timing for the instance at/rom/addr_reg_reg (implemented as a Block RAM) might be sub-optimal as no optional output register could be merged into the ram block. Providing additional output register may help in improving timing.
